# Shopping-Cart-OOP-PHP
Just a simple assignment I did in between my studies in the university. Main reason to do this was just to understand the OOP infrastructure of PHP better. 

Am I a master of the OOP PHP now? Nope. Do I understand OOP PHP better than I did in the past? Yes. Am I comfortable using OOP PHP in a big project? NO, Oh God NO. 
I do have a plan to build a full project in PHP. But I don't think I'm going to build it with the OOP technique I learned while building this. This was just a small part of a big project and yet I was confused a couple of times and got stuck like 1000s of times. 

But at least I can say that I know OOP PHP, I have worked with it and I can work with it in the future. Though I'm not fully comfortable with it but I know it properly.
