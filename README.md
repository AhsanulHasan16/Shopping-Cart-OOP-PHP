# Shopping-Cart-OOP-PHP
Just a simple assignment I did in between my studies in the university. Main reason to do this was just to understand the OOP infrastructure of PHP better. 

The code ain't fully complete yet. There are some methods that are yet needed to be fulfilled. Will do it soon. 

There ain't no web version of the index file. Compiled and tested the code with the command line terminal.
